### Notable Design features 

This website was created by a group, here are some features that I was specifically responsible for developing:
 - Adding the API that allowed users to create and edit documents directly in the course management website
 - Connecting the website to a databse where old courseoutline documents are stored (mongodb was used as the database)
 - Connecting parts of the front end and the backend using REST API calls
